EXAM HINTS:

- 3 questions, answer 2.

- Each question is from a different chapter
	- At least 1 chapter Eamonn covered.
	- At least 1 chapter Fergal covered.

- Question 1: 
	- Not nonlinear equations.
	- No subparts.
	- My guess - Something on matrices.. (maybe LU decomposition)
		- Might make sense since would take a long time to do, hence no subparts..?
- Question 2:
	- Some nonlinear equations.
	- 2 subparts.
	- Definitely has a table. (2D?)
	- May have a subpart on theory.

- Question 3:
	- Some nonlinear equations
	- At least 2 subparts.
	- Might have a table. (2D?)
	- May have a subpart on theory.

- General for all questions:
	- Guassian Quadriture will not be in any questions.
	- Matrix & Vector norms will be on the paper (indirectly relevant). (Question 1?)
	- Taylor series is fundamentally important and does appear on the exam.
	- Lagrange polynomial will be on the paper, but won't be derive general expression.
	- There will be a finite difference question, but may not be forward, backward, central.
	- There are no diagrams on the paper.
	- There will be a question on non-linear equations (Question 2 or 3).
	- Difference formulae will be relevant on the exam.
	- All important formulae are given.
	- There will be a question involving theory (Question 2 or 3).

- Matlab: 
	- Do not ignore Matlab.
	- Matlab is the nonlinear equation question. (Question 2 or 3)
	- 'matrix' appears on exam, probably Q1 on Matlab? (???)
	- Fergal wouldn't do the Matlab question. (Maybe because it's Eamonn's topic?)
	- Can't use builtin Matlab functions.
	- Matlab question and table question are seperate questions. *(Note this..)
	- At least one question on Matlab.
	- Will be a subpart of a question?

- Derivations: 
	- Derivations will be on the exam, formulae will be given.
	- Integration and differentiation will be necessary.
	- Has a start point or end point, but directed which to use. 
	- I'm guessing this will mostly have to do with difference formulae? 
	  Since there will be no derivation of a general expression of Lagrange Polynomial.
	  (e.g.) 'Derive a four-point backward difference formula'...(from sample paper Q3).

- Strings that appear / don't appear:
	- 'Windmill'.. (not sure if either appears or doesn't.. I think it doesn't)
	- 'Voltage'   does *not* appear on the exam.
	- 'Physician' does *not* appear on the exam.
	- 'Eigen'  does appear on the exam.
	- 'Define' does appear on the exam.. (not emphasised?)
	- 'Matrix' does appear on the exam.


- Predictions: 
	- Matlab Question:
		- I'm guessing it won't be question 1.. maybe question 2 since it has two subparts.
		- Would be similar to question 1 from sample paper then..
		  (i)  Write first 3 iterations.
		  (ii) Write MATLAB function for this method.
		- Best way to prepare is probably coding Matlab functions for all methods:
			- Bisecion Method.
			- Regula Falsi Method.
			- Newton's Method.
			- Secant Method.
			- Fixed-point iteration Method. (Unlikely in my opinion)
		- Similar questions to what I think this might be:
			- Sample paper question 1.
	
	- Lagrange Polynomial Question:
		- Probably question 3..?
		- Similar questions to what I think this might be:
			- Maybe sample paper question 2.. but that's deriving general expression,
			  this is not.

	- Finite Difference Question:
		- Probably question 3..?
		- Similar questions to what I think this might be:
			- Maybe sample paper question 3.. but hints say maybe not forward, 
			  backward, central.

	- Matrix Question:
		- Probably question 1..?
		- I'm guessing will be on LU Decompisition.
		- Only hint about matrices is that the word 'matrix' appears on the paper,
		  so could be only a part of a question.. shouldn't depend on it.
