EXAM HINTS

- 3 questions, answer 2.

- Each question is from a different chapter
	- At least 1 chapter Eamonn covered.
	- At least 1 chapter Fergal covered.

- Question 1: 
	- Not nonlinear equations.
	- No subparts.

- Question 2:
	- Some nonlinear equations.
	- 2 subparts.
	- Has a table. (2D?)
	- May have a subpart on theory.

- Question 3:
	- Some nonlinear equations
	- At least 2 subparts.
	- Might have a table. (2D?)
	- May have a subpart on theory.

- General for all questions:
	- Guassian Quadriture will not be in any questions.
	- Matrix & Vector norms will be on the paper (indirectly relevant).
	- Taylor series is fundamentally important and does appear on the exam.
	- Lagrange polynomial will be on the paper, but won't be derive general expression.
	- There will be a finite difference question, but may not be forward, backward, central.
	- There are no diagrams on the paper.
	- There will be a question on non-linear equations (Question 2 or 3).
	- Difference formulae will be relevant on the exam.
	- All important formulae are given.

- Matlab: 
	- Do not ignore Matlab.
	- Matlab is the nonlinear equation question.
	- 'matrix' appears on exam, probably Q1 on Matlab? 
	- Fergal wouldn't do the Matlab question.
	- Can't use builtin Matlab functions.
	- Matlab question and table question are seperate questions.
	- At least one question on Matlab.

- Derivations: 
	- Derivations will be on the exam, formulae will be given.
	- Integration and differentiation will be necessary.
	- Has a start point or end point, but directed which to use. 

- Strings that appear / don't appear:
	- 'Windmill'.. (not sure if either appears or doesn't)
	- 'Voltage'   does *not* appear on the exam.
	- 'Physician' does *not* appear on the exam.
	- 'Eigen'  does appear on the exam.
	- 'Define' does appear on the exam.. (not emphasised?)
	- 'Matrix' does appear on the exam.
