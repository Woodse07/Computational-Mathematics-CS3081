QUESTION 1:

A quarterback throws a pass to his wide receiver running a route. The quarterback releases
the ball at a height of h_q. The wide receiver is supposed to catch the ball straight down
the field 18m away at a height of h_r.

The equation that describes the motion of the football is the familiar equation of 
projectile motion from physics:

y = x tanθ - (1/2)(x^2*g/v^2_0)(1/cos^2(θ)) + h_q

Where x and y are the horizontal and vertical distance, respectively, g = 9.81ms^-2 is the
acceleration due to gravity, v_0 is the initial velocity of the football as it leaves the
quarterback's hand, and θ is the angle the football makes with the horizontal just as it 
leaves the quarterback's throwing hand. 

For v_0 = 15ms^-1, x = 18m, h_q = 2m, and h_r = 2.1m, find the angle θ at which the 
quarterback must launch the ball.

Write a user-defined function in MATLAB to find the solution(s) using the bisection method.
Write out the first three iterations. Comment on your results.
